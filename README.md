# Data-Wrangling2024

This repository contains files used in Duke Sports Analytics Club's Data Wrangling Workshop on February 27, 2024. A QMD containing the exercises and walkthrough of some key `dplyr` functions can be found in this repo. This is a great introductory workshop for beginners with R or data wrangling and perhaps want to be part of a project team for DSAC in the future. The data used in this workshop comes from Basketball-Reference.com, specifically their player total statistics for the 2023-24 season.
